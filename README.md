# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
This analysis was to study the relationship between city types and how that impacts rideshare fares for PyBer, a ride sharing company. It was requested that data be visualized in a format that's easy to digest by the leadership team, so that they may make better strategic business decisions. 

## Results
The total number of rides and total drivers followed an expected trend, decreasing as you move away from urban cities. The biggest takeaway from this analysis is that it seems there is a direct relationship between city type and ride demand versus available drivers. The further you move into the city, the amount of drivers sometimes exceeds ride demand. This does not impact the total fare revenue, however it ultimately affects the drivers ability to earn in urban areas as seen in the Average Fare per Ride/Driver. The difference between earning $55 and $16 is remarkable. Conversely, it appears the number of drivers in suburban and rural cities cannot keep up with demand, despite being incentivized by higher earnings.

When looking month to month in total fares by city type, nothing stands out as remarkable. As expected, urban cities have a significant advantage in month to month fare earnings compared to suburban and rural cities. The biggest takeaway is that upticks in total fare seem to occur at the same times of the month across all city types, particularly in late February.

## Summary
* Marketing should focus on recruiting more drivers in suburban and rural areas. Despite higher earnings, the demand for rides exceeds the number of available drivers. 
* Increase ride fares in urban cities to increase earning potential for drivers. Decrease fare in rural cities as increased earnings don't seem to incentivize the number of drivers that are available. 
* Incentivize drivers to take rides in Suburban and Rural areas in order to better distribute the fleat and improve customer experience.
